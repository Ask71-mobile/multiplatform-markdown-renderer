- Super simple setup
- Cross-platform ready
- Lightweight

## Setup

### Using Gradle

<details open><summary><b>Multiplatform</b></summary>
<p>

For multiplatform projects specify this single dependency:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.mikepenz:multiplatform-markdown-renderer:${version}")

    // Offers Material 2 defaults for Material 2 themed apps (com.mikepenz.markdown.m2.Markdown)
    implementation("com.mikepenz:multiplatform-markdown-renderer-m2:${version}")

    // Offers Material 3 defaults for Material 3 themed apps (com.mikepenz.markdown.m3.Markdown)
    implementation("com.mikepenz:multiplatform-markdown-renderer-m3:${version}")
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>JVM</b></summary>
<p>

To use the library on JVM, you have to include:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.mikepenz:multiplatform-markdown-renderer-jvm:${version}")
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>Android</b></summary>
<p>

For Android a special dependency is available:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.mikepenz:multiplatform-markdown-renderer-android:${version}")
}
```

</p>
</details>

> [!TIP]
> Since 0.13.0 the core library does not depend on a Material theme anymore. Include the `-m2`
> or `-m3` module to get
> access to the defaults.

## Usage

```Kotlin
val markdown = """
### What's included üöÄ

- Lightweight
""".trimIndent()

//
Markdown(markdown)
```

<details><summary><b>Advanced Usage</b></summary>
<p>

The library offers the ability to modify different behaviour when rendering the markdown.

### Provided custom style

```kotlin
Markdown(
    content,
    colors = markdownColors(text = Color.Red),
    typography = markdownTypography(h1 = MaterialTheme.typography.body1)
)
```

### Extended spans

Starting with 0.16.0 the library includes support
for [extended-spans](https://github.com/saket/extended-spans).
> The library was integrated to to make it multiplatform compatible. All credits for its
> functionality goes to [
Saket Narayan](https://github.com/saket).

It is not enabled by default, however you can enable it quickly by configuring the `extendedSpans`
for your `Markdown` composeable.
Define the `ExtendedSpans` you want to apply (including optionally your own custom ones) and return
it.

```kotlin
Markdown(
    content,
    extendedSpans = markdownExtendedSpans {
        val animator = rememberSquigglyUnderlineAnimator()
        remember {
            ExtendedSpans(
                RoundedCornerSpanPainter(),
                SquigglyUnderlineSpanPainter(animator = animator)
            )
        }
    }
)
```

### Extend Annotated string handling

The library already handles a significant amount of different tokens, however not all. To allow
special integrations expand this, you can pass in a custom `annotator` to the `Markdown`
composeable. This `annotator` allows you to customize existing handled tokens, but also add new
ones.

```kotlin
Markdown(
    content,
    annotator = markdownAnnotator { content, child ->
        if (child.type == GFMElementTypes.STRIKETHROUGH) {
            append("Replaced you :)")
            true // return true to consume this ASTNode child
        } else false
    }
)
```

### Adjust List Ordering

```kotlin
// Use the bullet list symbol from the original markdown
CompositionLocalProvider(LocalBulletListHandler provides { "$it " }) {
    Markdown(content)
}

// Replace the ordered list symbol with `A.)` instead.
CompositionLocalProvider(LocalOrderedListHandler provides { "A.) " }) {
    Markdown(content, Modifier.fillMaxSize().padding(16.dp).verticalScroll(scrollState))
}
```

### Custom Components

Since v0.9.0 it is possible to provide custom components, instead of the default ones.
This can be done by providing the components `MarkdownComponents` to the `Markdown` composable.

Use the `markdownComponents()` to keep defaults for non overwritten components.

The `MarkdownComponent` will expose access to
the `content: String`, `node: ASTNode`, `typography: MarkdownTypography`,
offering full flexibility.

```kotlin
// Simple adjusted paragraph with different Modifier.
val customParagraphComponent: MarkdownComponent = {
    MarkdownParagraph(it.content, it.node, Modifier.align(Alignment.End))
}

// Full custom paragraph example
val customParagraphComponent: MarkdownComponent = {
    // build a styled paragraph. (util function provided by the library)
    val styledText = buildAnnotatedString {
        pushStyle(LocalMarkdownTypography.current.paragraph.toSpanStyle())
        buildMarkdownAnnotatedString(content, it.node)
        pop()
    }

    // define the `Text` composable
    Text(
        styledText,
        modifier = Modifier.align(Alignment.End),
        textAlign = TextAlign.End
    )
}

// Define the `Markdown` composable and pass in the custom paragraph component
Markdown(
    content,
    components = markdownComponents(
        paragraph = customParagraphComponent
    )
)

```

</p>
</details>

### Image Loading

In the current versions of the library, image loading is included in different variants.

- Android: Uses `coil` to load images (Default configuration). The global `ImageLoader` is
  respected.
- JVM: Load image as HTTPUrlConnection and set to the view
- JS / Native: No image loading provided at this time

Provide your own `ImageTransformer` to the `Markdown` compose function to modify this behavior.

> [!NOTE]  
> It is planned to update to coil3 for all platforms once it reaches a more stable release cycle.

## Dependency

This project uses JetBrains [markdown](https://github.com/JetBrains/markdown/) Multiplatform
Markdown processor as
dependency to parse the markdown content.
